# DSA PATH

## 1️⃣ What is DSA?

**DSA = Data Structures and Algorithms**

- **Data Structure** → How data is stored
- **Algorithm** → Step-by-step method to solve a problem

### Real-life example:

- Phone contacts → Data Structure
- Searching a contact → Algorithm

👉 DSA helps you:

- Think logically
- Solve problems efficiently
- Write better programs

## 2️⃣ What are Data Types?

**Data Types tell the computer what type of data we are storing.**

| Data Type | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `int` | Integer numbers | 5, -10, 100 |
| `float` | Decimal numbers | 3.14, 2.5 |
| `double` | More precise decimals | 99.999 |
| `char` | Single character | 'A', 'z' |
| `bool` | True or False | true, false |

## 3️⃣ Loops

Loops are used when **something needs to repeat**.

### Why loops?

Instead of writing:

```jsx
cout << 1;
cout << 2;
cout << 3;
```

We use a loop:

```jsx
for(int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    cout << i;
}
```

### Types of loops:

- `for` loop → when count is known
- `while` loop → when condition matters
- `do-while` loop → runs at least once

## 4️⃣ if / else (Decision Making)

Used to **make decisions**.

### Example:

```cpp
if(age >=18) {
    cout <<"Adult";
}else {
    cout <<"Minor";
}
```

👉 Computer checks condition and decides what to do.
